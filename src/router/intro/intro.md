## About this Workshop

My goal is to get you excited to explore the data around you, and to share some of my solutions to achieve this.

We will be using `Vue.js` and `D3.js` to provide data manipulation in a reactive environment, and to show how powerful these two concepts are when used together.

We will start small by going over some features in both libraries, and work our way up to creating some nice visuals.

Hierarchical data will be our main focus for visualizing, however you will learn patterns that can be used in other aspects of data visualization.
