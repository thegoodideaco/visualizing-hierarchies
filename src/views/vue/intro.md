# What is Vue?

Vue is a progressive framework for building **user interfaces**. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

## Why use it?

There's nothing wrong with using another framework if it can do the same job that Vue helps with.

However, some parts of Vue compliment D3 and it's usage extremely well.

### Template syntax

Vue components have a template that serves as the markup of the component instance.

In most cases, a simple div element is used. However, you can do the same thing with an SVG!

Ability to construct an svg element instead.

Nestable components

### Reactivity

Vue will observe, and render information provided within objects. If at any time the values change, Vue handles it for you.
