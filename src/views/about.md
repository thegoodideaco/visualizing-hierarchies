# What is a Hierarchy

A Hierarchy is a special type of `graph`.

Graphs are simply structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.

They consist of vertices (nodes) which are connected by edges (links).

hierarchies are `unidirected` trees that follow specific rules:

> There Must be a single root node with no parent
>
> All nodes must have an edge
>
> Must be acylic
>
> Each node can only have 1 parent

## Uses

Hierarchies serve many purposes, and we use them on a daily basis

1. DOM Elements
1. Folders / Files
1. Decision Trees
1. Binary Trees
